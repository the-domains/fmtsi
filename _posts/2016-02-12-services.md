## Organizational Change Challenges

When your organization decides to make changes regarding its ERP or supply chain or customer relationship management application, a host of questions and their resulting decisions will determine your ROI and ultimate success.

* How will you move all your employees from the way they do business today to the way you want them to do business tomorrow?

* How will you communicate the vision of your newly transformed organization?

* What are the strategic and tactical issues that must be addressed?
